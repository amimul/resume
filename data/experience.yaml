  - title: Fast, Flexible Models for Discovering Topic Correlation across Weakly-Related Collections
    detail:
    - Developed two probabilistic topic models, Correlated LDA and Correlated HDP, for analyzing topic correlations between large, asymmetric, and potentially weakly-related collections.
    - Used C-LDA to compare over 300k documents in collections of sciences and humanities research from JSTOR.
  - title: Word semantic representations using Bayesian Probabilistic Tensor Factorization
    detail:
    - Developed a Bayesian probabilistic tensor factorization model for generating word vector representations and per-perspective linear transformations from any number of word similarity perspectives.
    - Evaluated the word embeddings with GRE antonym questions, achieved the state-of-the-art performance.
    - Paper presented in EMNLP'14, project will be integrated in IBM Waston.

  - title: Role Discovery based on Email Corpus
    detail:
    - Developed an application of semi-supervised learning that utilize Author Topic Model and graph Laplacian to automate role discovery with a small amount of training data.
  - title: Mention Network in the Enron Email Corpus
    detail:
    - We introduced a novel mention network from emails, then demonstrated such network can help predicting the organizational dominance in the Enron corporation.
    - Implemented graph walk and re-ranking algorithm for name disambiguation.
  - title: Extracting the Social Network of Taliban
    detail:
    - Used natural language processing technique to perform social event extraction over a large tranche of newspapers and magazines produced by Taliban, aim to construct a mapping of the social network of the Taliban leadership.
