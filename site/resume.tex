\section{Work experience}

\worklist{2012}{Data Mining Intern}{Tencent(QQ) Inc.}{
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Unveiling the Unique Features of Tencent Weibo}\newline{}
{\small
Used Hadoop to process collected data of more than 320M users and 3.7B microblogs on a cluster of 36 servers. Studied Tencent Weibo from both macro and micro levels, discovered interesting difference between Tencent Weibo and Twitter.
}
\item {\it User-level Microblog Recommendation based on Semi-Supervised Algorithm}\newline{}
{\small
Our group proposed a Factor Graph based microblog recommendation algorithm TSI-WR (Topic-Level Social Influence based Weibo Recommendation), outperformed several baseline methods. Responsible for data cleaning in the group.
}
\end{itemize}}

\section{Academic experience}

\worklist{2014}{Research assistant}{CS, Columbia U}{
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Extracting the Social Network of the Taliban (ongoing)}\newline{}
{\small
Using natural language processing technique to perform social event extraction over a large tranche of newspapers and magazines produced by Taliban, aim to construct a mapping of the social network of the Taliban leadership.
}
\end{itemize}}

\worklist{2013}{Bachelor thesis}{EE, THU}{
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Greedy Forwarding for Mobile Social Networks Embedded in Hyperbolic Spaces}\newline{}
{\small
Designed and evaluated a novel greedy message forwarding algorithm using metrics in hyperbolic spaces, obtained competitive performance in terms of message delivery ratio and cost. Poster presented in SIGCOMM'13.
}
\end{itemize}}

\worklist{2011}{Course project}{EE, THU}{
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Terrain Classification Based on Wavelet Method}\newline{}
{\small
Used locally stationary wavelet as a feature extraction method for classifying Brodatz textures. and Google Earth data.
}
\item {\it Music Transcription Using Gaussian Mixture Model and Beat Detection}\newline{}
{\small
Used beat detection (based on constant Q transform) and maximum likelihood estimation for music transcription.
}
\end{itemize}}

\worklist{2010}{Course project}{EE, THU}{
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Test and Evaluation of Background Extraction Algorithms}\newline{}
{\small
Implenmented some background extraction algorithms using C++, analyzed the applicabilities of each algorithm in varied conditions.
}
\item {\it Vocabulary-building software}\newline{}
{\small
Designed an application using MFC and XML, integrated multiple words lists and dictionaries, aimed to enhance memorization speed.
}
\end{itemize}}
